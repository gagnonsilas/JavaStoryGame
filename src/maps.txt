You wake up as someone bangs on your door, wait no, that is not your door. \nWhere are you? you look down at your body and realise that your body is gone \nand replaced by a pixelated something? It kind of looks like some sort of \nwizard from a video game or something. All of a sudden, text appears floating \nover your head that says \"PLAYER ONE - ONE TOKEN TO PLAY\". At once, \nyou realise what just must have happened. You are inside of a video game. \nIt seems to be one of those dungeon crawler games. Then the PLAYER ONE text starts \nflashing and you realise that the game is about to begin,,RIGHT
Just an empty room with three doors,,UP   RIGHT   LEFT
A empty room with only the door you came from,,LEFT
